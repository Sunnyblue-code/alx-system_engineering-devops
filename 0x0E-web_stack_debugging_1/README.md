# Web stack debugging #1

This project was the second installment in a series of web stack debugging tasks. In these assignments, I was presented with malfunctioning web stacks contained in isolated environments. My objective was to rectify the issues and restore the web stack to a functional state. To accomplish this, I developed a script for each task that automated the required commands to fix the web stack.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

- **0. Nginx likes port 80**

  - [0-nginx_likes_port_80](./0-nginx_likes_port_80): Bash script that
    configures Nginx to run and listen to port 80 on all of a server's active IPv4's.

- **1. Make it sweet and short**
  - [1-debugging_made_short](./1-debugging_made_short): Bash script that
    configures Nginx to listen to port 80 without running on all of a server's
    active IPv4's.
